# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Actions Windows build is failing due to Unicode encoding errors when the build scripts try to print emoji characters. The Windows console in CI environments uses CP1252 encoding which cannot handle Unicode emoji characters like ðŸš€, causing the build process to crash with a UnicodeEncodeError.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Windows build process to work reliably in GitHub Actions, so that I can automatically create Windows executables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build script runs in GitHub Actions THEN it SHALL NOT fail due to Unicode encoding errors
2. WHEN emoji characters are used in print statements THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN the build runs on Windows CI THEN it SHALL use appropriate encoding settings for console output

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want informative build output without encoding issues, so that I can monitor the build progress effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build script prints status messages THEN it SHALL use safe characters that work across all platforms
2. WHEN Unicode characters cannot be displayed THEN the system SHALL fall back to ASCII alternatives
3. WHEN running in CI environments THEN the output SHALL be readable and informative

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to be robust across different environments, so that it works consistently everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build runs on different operating systems THEN it SHALL handle encoding differences gracefully
2. WHEN the console encoding is limited THEN the system SHALL adapt its output accordingly
3. WHEN environment variables affect encoding THEN the build SHALL set appropriate defaults
