# macOS Build Workflow Summary

## Overview
Created a comprehensive `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml` workflow that mirrors the Windows workflow improvements and provides automated macOS application building and distribution.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Version Detection
- **Shared logic**: Uses the same version detection as Windows workflow
- **Smart triggering**: Only builds when `pyproject.toml` version changes
- **Parallel execution**: Runs alongside Windows builds automatically

### 2. Comprehensive macOS Build Process
- **App bundle creation**: Builds complete `.app` bundle using PyInstaller
- **DMG installer**: Creates professional macOS installer with drag-and-drop interface
- **ZIP distribution**: Creates ZIP file for direct distribution
- **Dual artifacts**: Both DMG and ZIP for different user preferences

### 3. Platform-Specific Testing
- **App structure validation**: Verifies correct `.app` bundle structure
- **Executable testing**: Tests that the main executable can start
- **Permission verification**: Ensures executable has correct permissions
- **DMG mounting**: Tests that DMG can be mounted and contains the app
- **ZIP extraction**: Verifies ZIP contents and app integrity

### 4. Professional Distribution
- **Version-specific naming**: `CSC-Reach-macOS-v1.0.2.zip` and `CSC-Reach-macOS.dmg`
- **Multiple formats**: Supports both ZIP and DMG distribution methods
- **Installation instructions**: Provides clear macOS-specific installation steps

## Workflow Structure

### Jobs Overview
1. **check-version**: Detects version changes (shared with Windows)
2. **build-macos**: Builds the macOS application and creates distributions
3. **test-macos-build**: Tests both ZIP and DMG artifacts

### Build Process
```bash
# 1. Environment setup
- macOS runner (latest)
- Python 3.11
- Install dependencies including macOS-specific packages

# 2. Build validation
- Check for build scripts and assets
- Verify macOS-specific imports (Foundation, ScriptingBridge)
- Validate icon files (.icns format)

# 3. Application building
- Run PyInstaller with macOS spec file
- Create .app bundle with proper structure
- Verify executable and permissions

# 4. Distribution creation
- Create DMG installer using hdiutil
- Create ZIP file with versioned naming
- Upload both artifacts

# 5. Release management
- Create Git tags automatically
- Publish GitHub releases with both DMG and ZIP
- Include macOS-specific installation instructions
```

## Distribution Files Created

### macOS Application Bundle
- **Location**: `build/dist/CSC-Reach.app`
- **Structure**: Complete macOS app bundle with proper Info.plist
- **Permissions**: Executable with correct macOS permissions
- **Integration**: Includes Outlook integration via ScriptingBridge

### DMG Installer
- **File**: `CSC-Reach-macOS.dmg`
- **Type**: Professional macOS installer
- **Usage**: Drag-and-drop installation to Applications folder
- **Benefits**: Native macOS installation experience

### ZIP Distribution
- **File**: `CSC-Reach-macOS-v1.0.2.zip`
- **Contents**: Complete .app bundle
- **Usage**: Direct extraction and use
- **Benefits**: Simpler distribution, no mounting required

## macOS-Specific Features

### Security Integration
- **App permissions**: Configured for Outlook integration
- **Usage descriptions**: Includes NSAppleEventsUsageDescription for Outlook access
- **Code signing ready**: Structure supports future code signing implementation

### Native macOS Experience
- **High DPI support**: NSHighResolutionCapable enabled
- **Proper bundle ID**: com.csc-reach.app
- **Version info**: Embedded version information in Info.plist
- **Icon integration**: Uses .icns format for native icon display

### Testing Capabilities
- **App startup testing**: Verifies the app can launch
- **Bundle validation**: Checks proper .app structure
- **DMG functionality**: Tests mounting and unmounting
- **Permission verification**: Ensures executable permissions are correct

## Integration with Windows Workflow

### Shared Components
- **Version detection**: Same logic for detecting version changes
- **Release creation**: Coordinated release with both Windows and macOS artifacts
- **Tagging strategy**: Single tag for both platforms
- **Documentation**: Unified release notes with platform-specific instructions

### Parallel Execution
- **Simultaneous builds**: Windows and macOS build at the same time
- **Independent failures**: One platform failure doesn't affect the other
- **Coordinated releases**: Both platforms contribute to the same GitHub release

## Usage Examples

### Triggering Builds
```bash
# Automatic trigger (same as Windows)
make release-patch    # Triggers both Windows and macOS builds

# Manual trigger via GitHub Actions
# - Go to Actions tab
# - Select "Build macOS Application"
# - Click "Run workflow"
```

### Testing Locally
```bash
# Build macOS app locally
python scripts/build/build_macos.py

# Create DMG locally
python scripts/build/create_dmg.py

# Test the built app
open build/dist/CSC-Reach.app
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ User Experience
- **Multiple installation options**: DMG for native experience, ZIP for simplicity
- **Professional presentation**: Proper macOS app bundle with icons and metadata
- **Clear instructions**: Platform-specific installation guidance

### ✅ Developer Experience
- **Automated workflow**: No manual intervention needed for macOS builds
- **Comprehensive testing**: Validates both distribution formats
- **Parallel builds**: Faster overall release process

### ✅ Distribution
- **Professional DMG**: Native macOS installer experience
- **Flexible options**: Users can choose DMG or ZIP based on preference
- **Version consistency**: Same version across all platforms

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Code signing**: Add Apple Developer certificate signing
2. **Notarization**: Apple notarization for enhanced security
3. **Universal binaries**: Support for both Intel and Apple Silicon
4. **App Store distribution**: Prepare for Mac App Store submission

### Monitoring
- **Build status**: Monitor both Windows and macOS builds in GitHub Actions
- **Release verification**: Check that both platforms are included in releases
- **User feedback**: Track which distribution format users prefer

## File Structure

### New Files Created
- `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml` - Complete macOS workflow
- `docs/summaries/macos-workflow-summary.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `Makefile` - Updated release commands to mention both platforms
- `docs/dev/automated-releases.md` - Updated to include macOS information

The macOS workflow is now production-ready and provides a comprehensive, automated build and distribution system that matches the quality and functionality of the Windows workflow.
