# macOS Permissions Fix Implementation Summary

## Issue Analysis

The user reported email sending failures on macOS with the error:
```
Not authorized to send Apple events to System Events
```

This error occurred because CSC-Reach was trying to use System Events to check if Outlook was running, but didn't have the necessary permissions.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **System Events Permission Issue**: The `is_outlook_running()` method was using System Events to check running processes, which requires explicit user permission on macOS.

2. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The `SessionSummary` dataclass was missing `channels_used` and `templates_used` fields that were being passed during instantiation, causing database errors.

3. **Poor Error Messages**: Users weren't getting clear guidance on how to fix permission issues.

4. **Lack of Diagnostic Tools**: No easy way for users to check their setup and permissions.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed System Events Dependency

**File**: `src/multichannel_messaging/services/outlook_macos.py`

**Changes**:
- Replaced System Events-based process checking with direct Outlook AppleScript queries
- Added fallback methods using shell commands (`pgrep`, `ps`) that don't require special permissions
- Implemented multiple fallback strategies for maximum compatibility

**Before**:
```python
script = '''
tell application "System Events"
    return (name of processes) contains "Microsoft Outlook"
end tell
'''
```

**After**:
```python
script = '''
try
    tell application "Microsoft Outlook"
        return true
    end tell
on error
    return false
end try
'''
# Plus shell command fallbacks
```

### 2. Fixed Database Schema Issues

**File**: `src/multichannel_messaging/core/message_logger.py`

**Changes**:
- Added missing `channels_used` and `templates_used` fields to `SessionSummary` dataclass
- Updated all SessionSummary instantiations to handle the new fields properly
- Added proper JSON serialization/deserialization for list fields

**Before**:
```python
@dataclass
class SessionSummary:
    # ... other fields ...
    user_id: str
```

**After**:
```python
@dataclass
class SessionSummary:
    # ... other fields ...
    user_id: str
    channels_used: List[str] = None
    templates_used: List[str] = None
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.channels_used is None:
            self.channels_used = []
        if self.templates_used is None:
            self.templates_used = []
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling and User Guidance

**File**: `src/multichannel_messaging/services/outlook_macos.py`

**Changes**:
- Added `check_permissions()` method to proactively check for issues
- Enhanced error messages with specific guidance
- Added references to documentation for users

**New Features**:
```python
def check_permissions(self) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
    """Check if CSC-Reach has necessary permissions."""
    # Comprehensive permission checking
    
def send_email(self, customer: Customer, template: MessageTemplate) -> bool:
    # Check permissions first before attempting to send
    has_permissions, issues = self.check_permissions()
    if not has_permissions:
        # Provide specific guidance to users
```

### 4. Created Diagnostic Tools

**New Files**:

#### `scripts/dev/macos_diagnostic.py`
- Comprehensive system diagnostic tool
- Checks Outlook installation, permissions, dependencies
- Tests AppleScript access and email creation
- Provides specific solutions for each issue found

#### `scripts/dev/test_outlook_integration.py`
- Simple integration test that creates a draft email
- Verifies the complete email workflow
- User-friendly output with clear success/failure indicators

#### `docs/user/macos_permissions_guide.md`
- Step-by-step guide for granting macOS permissions
- Screenshots descriptions for different macOS versions
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Security notes explaining what permissions are used for

### 5. Updated Documentation and Build System

**Files Updated**:
- `README.md`: Added macOS permissions section with quick setup verification
- `Makefile`: Added diagnostic targets (`make diagnose`, `make test-outlook`, `make check-permissions`)

## User Experience Improvements

### Before the Fix
1. User tries to send emails
2. Gets cryptic "Not authorized" error
3. No guidance on how to fix the issue
4. Database errors compound the problem

### After the Fix
1. User runs `make diagnose` or `python scripts/dev/macos_diagnostic.py`
2. Gets clear report of what's working and what needs fixing
3. Follows step-by-step guide in `docs/user/macos_permissions_guide.md`
4. Runs `make test-outlook` to verify everything works
5. CSC-Reach provides helpful error messages if issues remain

## Technical Benefits

1. **No System Events Dependency**: App works without accessibility permissions
2. **Multiple Fallback Methods**: Robust process detection across macOS versions
3. **Proactive Permission Checking**: Issues caught before user attempts to send emails
4. **Self-Diagnostic Capabilities**: Users can troubleshoot independently
5. **Better Error Recovery**: Database schema issues resolved

## Testing and Validation

The implementation includes:
- Comprehensive diagnostic script that tests all components
- Integration test that creates actual draft emails
- Multiple fallback methods for different macOS configurations
- Clear success/failure indicators for users

## Future Considerations

1. **Automated Permission Requests**: Could implement automatic permission request flows
2. **GUI Diagnostic Panel**: Add diagnostic tools to the main application UI
3. **Permission Status Indicators**: Show permission status in the main window
4. **One-Click Setup**: Streamline the permission granting process

## Files Modified
