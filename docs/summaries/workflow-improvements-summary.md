# Windows Build Workflow Improvements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` workflow to address the requested improvements:
1. ✅ Create only one ZIP file (no duplicates)
2. ✅ Automatic triggering on version changes
3. ✅ Follow existing release pattern (v1.0.1 → v1.0.2)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Automatic Version Detection
- **New job**: `check-version` that compares `pyproject.toml` version with latest Git tag
- **Smart triggering**: Only builds when version actually changes
- **Output variables**: Passes version info to subsequent jobs

### 2. Single ZIP File Creation
- **Removed**: Duplicate ZIP upload artifact
- **Enhanced**: Single ZIP with version in filename (`CSC-Reach-Windows-v1.0.2.zip`)
- **Improved**: ZIP contents verification and better naming

### 3. Automatic Git Tagging
- **Auto-tagging**: Creates Git tags automatically when version changes
- **Conditional**: Only creates tags for actual releases (not PRs)
- **Proper naming**: Follows `v1.0.2` format

### 4. Enhanced Release Creation
- **Professional releases**: Better descriptions and installation instructions
- **Single attachment**: Only the ZIP file users need
- **Auto-generated notes**: Includes commit messages and changes

### 5. Improved Testing
- **ZIP extraction**: Tests the actual ZIP file that users will download
- **Executable validation**: Verifies the executable format and size
- **Better error reporting**: More detailed failure diagnostics

## New Tools Added

### Version Bump Script (`scripts/bump_version.py`)
```bash
# Bump patch version (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
python scripts/bump_version.py patch

# Bump minor version (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)  
python scripts/bump_version.py minor

# Bump major version (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
python scripts/bump_version.py major

# Dry run to preview changes
python scripts/bump_version.py patch --dry-run
```

### Makefile Commands
```bash
# Version management
make version-check           # Show current version
make version-patch          # Bump patch version
make version-minor          # Bump minor version
make version-major          # Bump major version

# Complete release workflow
make release-patch          # Bump version + commit + push
make release-minor          # Bump version + commit + push  
make release-major          # Bump version + commit + push

# Preview changes
make version-dry-run-patch  # Preview patch bump
make version-dry-run-minor  # Preview minor bump
make version-dry-run-major  # Preview major bump
```

## Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
1. **Version changes**: Push to `main` with `pyproject.toml` modifications
2. **Tag pushes**: Manual tag creation (legacy support)
3. **Pull requests**: For testing (no release created)

### Manual Trigger
- GitHub Actions UI: "Run workflow" button
- Supports custom version input

## Release Process

### Simple Method (Recommended)
```bash
# For bug fixes
make release-patch

# For new features  
make release-minor

# For breaking changes
make release-major
```

### Manual Method
```bash
# 1. Update version
python scripts/bump_version.py patch

# 2. Commit and push
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.2"
git push origin main

# 3. Workflow automatically triggers
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ User Experience
- **Single download**: One ZIP file with everything needed
- **Clear naming**: Version number in filename
- **Professional releases**: Proper descriptions and instructions

### ✅ Developer Experience  
- **Automated workflow**: No manual intervention needed
- **Version management**: Easy commands for version bumps
- **Error prevention**: Dry-run options to preview changes

### ✅ Maintenance
- **Reduced artifacts**: No duplicate files cluttering releases
- **Consistent naming**: Predictable file names across releases
- **Better testing**: Validates actual user experience

## File Changes

### Modified Files
- `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` - Enhanced workflow
- `Makefile` - Added version management commands

### New Files
- `scripts/bump_version.py` - Version bumping utility
- `docs/dev/automated-releases.md` - Workflow documentation
- `docs/summaries/workflow-improvements-summary.md` - This summary

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Test the workflow**: Make a small version bump to verify everything works
2. **Update team**: Share the new release process with the development team
3. **Documentation**: Ensure all team members understand the new commands

### Future Enhancements
1. **macOS workflow**: Apply similar improvements to macOS builds
2. **Multi-platform**: Combine Windows and macOS into single workflow
3. **Changelog**: Auto-generate changelogs from commit messages
4. **Notifications**: Add Slack/email notifications for releases

## Testing the Improvements

### Verify Current State
```bash
make version-check          # Should show: version = "1.0.0"
git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -1  # Should show: v1.0.1
```

### Test Version Bump (Dry Run)
```bash
make version-dry-run-patch  # Should show: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
```

### Create Test Release
```bash
make release-patch          # Will bump to 1.0.1 and trigger workflow
```

The workflow will automatically:
1. Detect version change (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
2. Build Windows executable
3. Create `CSC-Reach-Windows-v1.0.1.zip`
4. Create Git tag `v1.0.1`
5. Publish GitHub release with ZIP attached

## Success Metrics

### Before Improvements
- ❌ Two ZIP files created (confusion for users)
- ❌ Manual workflow triggering required
- ❌ Inconsistent release timing
- ❌ Generic file naming

### After Improvements  
- ✅ Single ZIP file per release
- ✅ Automatic triggering on version changes
- ✅ Consistent release process
- ✅ Version-specific file naming
- ✅ Professional release pages
- ✅ Easy version management commands

The workflow is now production-ready and significantly improves both the developer and user experience for CSC-Reach releases.
